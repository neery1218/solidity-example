# solidity-example
playing around with solidity. I took the Coin example from https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#subcurrency-example 
and added some tests

## Get started with solidity 
Download forge: https://github.com/gakonst/foundry
Forge is a tool used to compile and test solidity code. It's the easiest tool ive used so far.

Then, the command below creates this repo.
```
forge init
```

To compile and run the tests, do:
```
forge test -vvv
```
